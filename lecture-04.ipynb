    "### Natural selection and genetic drift\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that natural selection and genetic drift can interact in complicated ways. When an allele is very rare (for example, a new mutation), its initial fate is determined almost entirely by drift. Once the allele grows larger than an establishment frequency ($\\sim 1/s$ following [Desai and Fisher](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/176/3/1759/6062236), but keep in mind that this is a fuzzy boundary rather than a sharp one) its future change is determined more strongly by selection. In particular, alleles for which $2Ns\\gg 1$ will grow rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll explore the interaction between drift and selection in simulations. To do this, we'll use the Wright-Fisher model that we considered previously, but adapted to take natural selection into account. To make our analysis simpler, we'll also assume that we're working with a haploid population rather than diploids, allowing us to avoid complications due to dominance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, let's call two types of alleles A and B, with frequencies $p$ and $1-p$. Under the Wright-Fisher model **without selection**, the probability of getting $n$ alleles of type A in the next generation is binomial,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(n) = \\binom{N}{n} p^n \\left(1-p\\right)^{N-n}\\,. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're considering haploids, the total number of alleles is equal to the population size $N$ instead of $2N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for selection, we simply adjust the probability $p$ that appears in the binomial distribution above. Instead of depending only on the allele frequency, we now weight the probability by fitness. If the fitness of the A allele is $1+s$ and the fitness of the B allele is $1$, then the probability to select an A allele $p_A$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_A = \\frac{p (1 + s)}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p (1 + s)}{p (1 + s) + (1 - p)} \\,. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this adjustment, the probability of obtaining $n$ A alleles in the next generation is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(n) = \\binom{N}{n} p_A^n \\left(1-p_A\\right)^{N-n}\\,. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this expression to simulate the number of A alleles over time in a population. We'll run the simulation multiple times and plot the results to get a sense of the randomness involved in this process."
