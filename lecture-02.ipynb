    "We saw that genetic drift removes genetic variation over time as alleles fix or are lost. Mutation helps to counteract this progressive loss by introducing new genetic variation into populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One model for this process is the [infinite allele model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_alleles_model), where we assume that there is some rate $2u$ for mutations per reproduction cycle (so $2Nu$ over a population of $N$ individuals), and that each mutation results in a new allele. Kimura and Crow used this model to predict homozygosity and the number of alleles maintained in a population. Specifically, the probability $G$ that an individual is homozygous is predicted to be \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G = \\frac{1}{1 + 4 N u}\\,, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and (the lower bound for) the number of alleles $n$ maintained in the population is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n \\sim \\frac{1}{G} = 1 + 4 N u\\,. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll write some code to simulate this model and to check its predictions using different values for the population size and mutation rate."
