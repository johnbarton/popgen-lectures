    "### Reduction in diversity near a beneficial mutation after a selective sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "One dramatic consequence of genetic linkage is that neutral alleles near an allele under selection can dramatically increase (or decrease) in frequency due to linkage disequilibrium. This process is called [genetic hitchhiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_hitchhiking). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will simulate loss of diversity at a neutral locus at various \"distances\" (measured by the ratio of the recombination probability $r$ and the selection coefficient of the beneficial allele, $s$) from an allele undergoing a selective sweep. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make our analysis simpler, we'll consider a haploid model instead of diploids. In this model we consider two loci, labeled 1 and 2, which can have either A or B alleles. We'll assume that the B allele at site 1 is beneficial with selection coefficient $s$, and both alleles at site 2 are neutral. The fitness values of the different genotypes are then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{BA} = w_{BB} = 1 + s, \\quad w_{AA} = w_{AB} = 1\\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that under the Wright-Fisher model, the change in genotype frequency after selection is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p^\\prime_G = \\frac{w_G}{\\bar{w}}p_G\\, \\quad \\bar{w} = \\sum_G w_G p_G\\,. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population is haploid, then this is also the change in genotype frequencies after one generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will add recombination to this model. The probability of recombination per reproductive cycle is $r$, and the recombination partner is chosen at random from the population. The probability of producing a particular genotype $G = \\{g_1, g_2\\}$ through recombination is equal to the product of the corresponding allele frequences at sites one and two, $p_1(g_1)\\,p_2(g_2)$. So, combining selection and recombination the change in genotype frequencies between successive generations is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p^\\prime_G = \\left(1 - r\\right) \\frac{w_G}{\\bar{w}} p_G + r\\, p_1(g_1)\\, p_2(g_2)\\,. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this model in hand, we can simulate how genetic diversity will change a the neutral locus two due to linkage with locus one. As in the book, let's assume that one copy of the beneficial B allele at site one appears together with an A allele at site two, and the initial allele frequency at site two is $p_2(A) = p_2(B) = 1/2$. This choice is arbitrary; the beneficial allele could just as well have appeared together with a B allele at site two. "
